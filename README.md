# uniswap-clone

Building the Uniswap Blockchain Web 3.0 App using Solidity, Next JS, Sanity.io, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel. Credits to https://github.com/CleverProgrammers

Will update as I go along building my first DEX

Tutorial just had a simple SC and covered more about the integration of metamask and the use of React Context. A really fast tutorial overall that skimmed through the explanation of some parameters. Ended up not really building a uniswap function, there is not swapping involved but just merely sending of ETH from one account to another. Also it is using the wrong practise for private keys which breaks my heart:(

Completed Dapp and deployed via vercel to: https://uniswap-blockchain-clone-ruby.vercel.app/

To run locally, clone the repo, go to `studio`
```sanity start```

go to `client`
```npm run dev```

then you can view your app on localhost:3000. Take note of some configurations in `lib` folder under `client`
